Rating Middleware for CCNQ4
---------------------------

This `useful-wind`/`thinkable-ducks` middleware uses the rating engine from `entertaining-crib` and relies on data injected by `huge-play`'s `cdr` middleware.

Client-side CDR is generated if the endpoint data is available in the session (this is normally done by `huge-play`).
Carrier-side CDR is generated if the winner carrier data is available in the session (this is normally done by `tough-rate`).
